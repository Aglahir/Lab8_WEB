# Lab 8 Web

> This repository contains the 8th laboratory for my web development class.

This lab includes an API for bookmarks with GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH HTTP Methods. Please install npm modules from package.json

This is an improvement from Lab7, now this repository manages mongodb collections instead of arrays.
